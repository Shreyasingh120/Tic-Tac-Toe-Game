# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with either "X" or "O", and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.
